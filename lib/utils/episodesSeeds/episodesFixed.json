We hear Pearl's voice, and the camera moves to show Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl. Pearl asks if Steven is ready to go on a mission. Steven tells the Gems that he can't, because he is doing a video review. Confused, Amethyst asks Steven if he is doing a review of a box, and Steven replies, \"No! Of a bag!\" Pearl accepts his excuse, and tells Steven to have fun with his bag. Amethyst points to the box and states that Lion is already helping. The camera goes back down to show Lion chewing on the box. Steven admonishes Lion, and the star iris closes on Lion's face.",
